      <title>Complex Environmental Problems</title>
      <para id="id1172603959737">NEPA, both in tone and purpose, was in sharp contrast to the many environmental laws that followed in the 1970s and 1980s that defined increasingly proscriptive methods for controlling risks from chemical exposure (this is sometimes termed the "<link url="http://www.enviroliteracy.org/article.php/1329.html" window="new">command-and-control</link>" approach to environmental management). In many ways these laws and regulations are ill-suited to the types of environmental problems that have emerged in the past twenty years. Whereas the focus of our environmental policy has been on mitigating risk from local problems that are chemical – and media – (land, water, or air) specific, the need has arisen to address problems that are far more complex, multi-media, and are of large geographic, sometimes global, extent.</para>
      <para id="id1172590302036">An early example of this type of shift in the complexity of environmental problems is illustrated by the phenomenon of <link url="http://www.epa.gov/ne/eco/acidrain/history.html" window="new">acidic rainfall</link>, a regional problem that occurs in many areas across the globe. Although the chemical cause of acid rain is acidic gases (such as <link url="http://www.epa.gov/oaqps001/sulfurdioxide/" window="new">sulfur dioxide</link> and <link url="http://www.epa.gov/oaqps001/nitrogenoxides/" window="new">nitrogen oxides</link>) released into the atmosphere from combustion processes (such as coal burning), the problem was made considerably worse because of the approach to problem solving typical of the day for episodes such as the Donora disaster (see Figures <link document="m42115" target-id="id1165880482599"><emphasis effect="bold">Zinc Smelter</emphasis></link> and <link document="m42115" target-id="id8096046"><emphasis effect="bold">Noon in Donora</emphasis></link>).</para>

      <para id="id1172591578200">In order to prevent the local accumulation of contaminants, emission stacks were made much taller, effectively relying on the diluting power of the atmosphere to disperse offending pollutants. The result was a significant increase in the acidity of rainfall downwind of major sources, with associated impacts on aquatic and forest resources. Figure <link target-id="id1172601060360"><emphasis effect="bold">Hydrogen Ion Concentrations as pH for 1996</emphasis></link> shows this pattern for the eastern United States in 1996. A more comprehensive solution to this problem (short of replacing coal as a fuel source), has involved integrated activity on many fronts: science to understand the impacts of acid rain, technology to control the release of acidic gases, politics in the form of amendments to the <link url="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/" window="new">Clean Air Act</link>, social equity that defined the role of regional responsibilities in the face of such large geographic disparities, and economics to understand the total costs of acid rain and <link url="http://www.edf.org/page.cfm?tagID=1085" window="new">design markets</link> to spread the costs of control. Although acidic rainfall is still an issue of concern, its impacts have been mitigated to a significant degree.</para>

      <para id="id1172596335714">Wicked problems are not confined to environmental issues, for example the same characteristics arise for problems such as food safety, health care disparities, and terrorism, but in the context of environmental policy they create the need to reassess policy approaches and goals, laws and regulations, as well as methods and models for integrated research. </para>
      <para id="id1172593783891">Table <link target-id="id1172599084052"><emphasis effect="bold">The Evolution of U.S. Environmental Policy</emphasis></link> summarizes the major attributes of U.S. environmental policy as it has evolved over the past two centuries. To most observers it would seem to be true that advances in public policy, in any realm, are driven by problems, real and perceived, that require systemic solutions. Environmental policy is no exception. Early conservationists were alarmed at the inefficiencies of human resource management and the encroachment of humans on unspoiled lands. During the 20<sup>th</sup> century many groups: scientists, economists, politicians, and ordinary citizens, became alarmed and fearful of the consequences of toxic pollutant loads to the environment that included localized effects on human health and well-being. And now, as we proceed into the 21<sup>st</sup> century, an array of complex problems that have the potential to alter substantially the structure and well-being of large segments of human societies, calls for a renewal and reassessment of our approach to environmental policy. This has, thus far, proven to be a difficult transition. Many of these complex problems have multiple causes and impacts, affect some groups of people more than others, are economically demanding, and are often not as visibly apparent to casual observers as previous impacts, nor are the benefits perceived to be commensurate with costs. Devising a regulatory strategy for such problems requires an adaptive and flexible approach that current laws do not foster.</para>
